# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_

## Prep

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

_Setting:_ In an apartment bedroom or living area.

_Players:_ Myself or any student, employee, or person with a need to leave at an exact time. 

_Activity:_ The blinking light reminds someone to leave now from their room or apartment. Just like an intermission signal at a Broadway show. 

_Goals:_ Get to the elevator with 10 minutes to spare before class.

\*\***Feedback**\*\*
Would be very helpful for reminding yourself just like setting alarms, but less intrusive to those around you. May be better suited to nighttime alarms since it will be faint in the daylight.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

The interaction was tested using the tinkerbelle link on my phone and computer. The different colors work really well for signalling a traffic stop style of alarm response. As with other projects, it seems the colored screen is too dim to gain the attraction of many while their attention is on another task. Peripheral vision may be to much to rely on. Pairing a sound with the alarm or maybe just adding more lights will help alert people more often.

## Part C. Prototype the device

Wish I could schedule audio and color changes in time through code. 

## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someoneâ€™s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

## Part E. Costume the device

The device is designed to blend it with the rest of the apartment, as normal as possible until required to be an alarm.

## Part F. Record

# Staging Interaction, Part 2

\*\***Feedback**\*\* 
- Slow down the interaction to make it more than an alert. 
- Use more than a red and green traffic light to communicate. 
- Expand the functionality to communicate weather. 
- Integrate with a directions app or website to incorporate traffic. Traffic can alter the time window that the alerts become more insistent and urgent. 

## Make it your own

_Setting:_ In an apartment bedroom or living area, at The House. In a bedside table, a desk, or a living room lamp. 

_Players:_ Myself or any student, employee, or person with a need to leave at an exact time. 

_Activity:_ Due to my own history of being late to classes, I decided to address three common reasons I found. First, in many cases I will sleep through my alarm at the beginning of the day. This is usually due to my unconcious ability to turn off an alarm but not truly wake up. Second, in the cases when I remember to set alarms for midday classes, I am usually wearing headphones while studying or working on assignments. Thus, I don't even realize an alarm is going off. Third, and very specific to living on campus, elevators become very crowded five minutes before classes as everyone leaves as late as they can. This can mean I have to wait for a couple elevators to pass through before I find one with space. There are two main functions of the device: 1) blinking lights and sounds remind someone to leave now from their room or apartment, and 2) a gentle brightening of the lights before eventual softer alarm sounds to wake someone up after sleeping overnight.

_Goals:_ Get to the elevator with 10 minutes to spare before classes begin.

How it works: This smart-bulb is enhanced with a small speaker to provide both audio and visual cues for the alarm. It connects with your Apple Home app and Clock apps to schedule the lighting events. There is rudimentary logic to control what type of alarm it is depending on what time of day it is.
